"A World Divided"

Taught to be afraid of me, so you don't understand,
I'm hanging on the edge but you won't reach for my hand
If we came face to face you would see no difference between you and me (we are the same)
But we let the hate radiate out of us like a sun, watch it burn through our veins.

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other, nothing's as it seems
But between white walls
We could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid
A world divided and afraid!

The rumors and lies, brought us apart
Leaving us on separate sides
I just play like a work of art, these lies are here to keep us in the dark

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other, nothing's as it seems
But between white walls, we could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid!

We need to break the cycle of hate!
We need to break the cycle of hate!

Divided by the colors
Split by our beliefs
Forced against each other, nothing's as it seems
But between white walls
We could forget it all
The fear would fade, we could start to change
A world divided and afraid
A world divided and afraid!
