You had my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share

Because when the sun shines we?ll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

These fancy things will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part, when the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

You can run into my arms, it's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me, there's no distance in between our love
So go on let the rain pour I'll be all you need and more

Because when the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath I'ma stick it out 'til the end

Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ayï»¿
