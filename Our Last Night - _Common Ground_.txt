Our Last Night - "Common Ground"

I know we want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flame as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground
We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground
It's so hard to find the truth
When the other side wants to bury you, to bury you
And it's so hard to find a way
When the other side wants to play you like a game
It's all about who's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just wanna fight
If different thinkers are enemies, just think what we could be, if our thoughts were in harmony
I know we want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flame as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground
We can't find common ground so we agree to burn it down
We can't let it burn down so we need to find common ground
We're stuck in a maze of conviction
Every path leads back to the beginning
It's all about what's wrong and who's right
Don't wanna learn, we just wanna fight
We've been buried alive between dreams and reality, well maybe truth can set us free
I know we want to do the right thing
But the needle in our compass is trembling
Trapped in the flame as our house burns down
Left for dead cause we can't find common ground
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate
Your heart's in the same place
But your mind is a million miles away
And it's forcing us to separate
