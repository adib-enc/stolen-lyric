[Verse 1]
今到着成田, 汚れ物アメリカ
前はマクドナルド, 今食べてるキャビア
喋り方がキャビア, 紙書く雷 yeah
渋谷クラブ入り, VIP 酒とCali bud, yeah
上がる夢を見てるいつも通り
シャンパンを開けて飲んでる、水のように
東京に行ったら渋谷立ってて地図を読む
ニューヨーク帰ったら普通のアジア人に戻る

英語何もわかりません、俺の女は韓国人
洋服ほとんど中国から、今からパリ服をゲッツ
ゲッツマニー確かにやね、ゲッツマニーってわかるよね？
アルバム終わったら後すぐ国出る I'mma fuck up a check
なめらか with the flow, everybody on the floor
どこでも出身、everybody puffin dro
ドープ欲しい人いるから僕エスコバル、アルポ
ポケットの中パスポート見つかるわけないよ

[Verse 2]
Me no speak no English
These fools who just see pigment
Them labels just see business
I'm a NY child with my fitted hat down
To the brows, I been tryna make an imprint
'Cause in my whole life was a Misfit
Now the hoes back 'round 'cause they miss kid!
I'm getting back in my zone
Made a new path for the wave, now I'm traveling home
Most of the time I keep hands on my paper
My head in the clouds, I can't answer the phone
Most of them telling me that I'm a star
Bitch, I'm the crew and the cast of the show!
Growing up top of the Tokyo tower
My aura is powerful speaking in tongues of my own

[Chorus]

VERSE 1
 
Just arrived at Narita, a dirty America
Before it was McDonald's, now I eat caviar
The way that I speak is caviar, writing lightning on paper
Go to a club in Shibuya, VIP drinks and Cali bud
Yeah, always seeing dreams of elevating
Pop champagne and drink it like it's water
Go to Tokyo and stand in middle of Shibuya with a map
Go back to New York and i'm a regular Asian American again

I really don't know any English, my girl is Korean
Most of my clothes made in China, I'm tryna get the clothes from Paris
Surely I must get money, You know about getting money ?
After I finish the album I'm leaving the country immediately
im a fuck up a check
(im a fuck up a check)
 
Laid back with the flow, Everybody on the floor,
Wherever you're from, Everybody puffin dro
People want the dope I be like Escobar and Alpo,
Got the passport in my pocket mother fucker you can't find me ! Yeah
 
CHORUS
