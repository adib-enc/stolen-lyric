oln falling away

Our communication is down again
Is down again
Even though it feels like
We've lost it all
I promise you the love is in the air
My mind is never changing
Because my bones are never breaking

If I'm falling away
Don't let me go
You got something to say
And I need to know
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
If I'm falling away
Don't let me go

I know I leave for months at a time
But you never leave my mind
You stay locked away
You ain't easy to find
The miles don't affect me
They make me realize
What I'd be missing all this time
My mind is never changing
Because my bones are never breaking

If I'm falling away
Don't let me go
You got something to say
And I need to know
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
If I'm falling away
Don't let me go

Our signal is breaking up
Try to hear me through the static
Through the static
And trust me that I'm on the other end
Try to hear me through the static
Through the static
Our communication is down again

If I'm falling away
Don't let me go
You got something to say
And I need to know
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
If I'm falling away
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
